Ayah does not condone or allow the hiring of foreign nationals outside the prescribed laws of any country in which it operates.

Each country has its own immigration and employment laws. Ayah does not offer legal advice. So, if you do not understand the laws of your country, seek appropriate legal counsel to be sure you understand and abide by proper work visa and employment laws when hiring a foreign national.

Ayah members who attempt to subvert the labor laws and visa regulations of their country may be removed from the Ayah website and disallowed future access. Determination of violation shall be at the sole discretion of Ayah.
